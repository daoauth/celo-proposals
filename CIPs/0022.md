# CIP [0022]: Standard for Injacted web3 Provider

- Date: 2020-10-29
- Author: @daoauth @NAKsir-melody
- Status: DRAFT

## Overview
- Standard to find out the type of web3 provider to support dapps running in web browsers

## Goals
- In the case of web DApps, you can only use [DSRV Celo Extension Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celo-desktop-wallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh) or MetaMask Extension wallet, but a standard is required to distinguish them.
- Through these standards, each provider can be identified and transactions can be sent to the Celo blockchain through appropriate operations.

## Proposed Solution
- Ready `ethereum.isMetaMask` property for MetaMask. Through this property, it can be seen that it is a provider injected in MetaMask.
- So, it is suggested that providers injected in Celo have a property with the syntax of `celo[providerName]`.
  * eg. Some injected provider has `celo.isExtWallet` property. It's injected by DSRV Celo Extension wallet
  * eg. For DApp browser has `celo.isDexFair` too
